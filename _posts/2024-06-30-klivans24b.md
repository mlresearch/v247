title: 'Learning Intersections of Halfspaces with Distribution Shift: Improved Algorithms
  and SQ Lower Bounds'
section: Original Papers
abstract: "  Recent work of Klivans, Stavropoulos, and Vasilyan initiated the study
  of testable learning with distribution shift (TDS learning), where a learner is
  given labeled samples from training distribution $\\mathcal{D}$, unlabeled samples
  from test distribution $\\mathcal{D}’$, and the goal is to output a classifier with
  low error on $\\mathcal{D}’$ whenever the training samples pass a corresponding
  test.  Their model deviates from all prior work in that no assumptions are made
  on $\\mathcal{D}’$.  Instead, the test must accept (with high probability) when
  the marginals of the training and test distributions are equal.  Here we focus on
  the fundamental case of intersections of halfspaces with respect to Gaussian training
  distributions and prove a variety of new upper bounds including a $2^{(k/\\epsilon)^{O(1)}}
  \\mathsf{poly}(d)$-time algorithm for TDS learning intersections of $k$ homogeneous
  halfspaces to accuracy $\\epsilon$ (prior work achieved $d^{(k/\\epsilon)^{O(1)}}$).
  \ We work under the mild assumption that the Gaussian training distribution contains
  at least an $\\epsilon$ fraction of both positive and negative examples ($\\epsilon$-balanced).
  \ We also prove the first set of SQ lower-bounds for any TDS learning problem and
  show (1) the $\\epsilon$-balanced assumption is necessary for $\\mathsf{poly}(d,1/\\epsilon)$-time
  TDS learning for a single halfspace and (2) a $d^{\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\log 1/\\epsilon)}$
  lower bound for the intersection of two general halfspaces, even with the $\\epsilon$-balanced
  assumption. Our techniques significantly expand the toolkit for TDS learning.  We
  use dimension reduction and coverings to give efficient algorithms for computing
  a localized version of discrepancy distance, a key metric from the domain adaptation
  literature."
